<b>Test Project Name:</b> Auto Color Text Prototype <br><br>
                <b>Instructions:</b>Select the color point. Its gonna change the text color to white* when you select any dark background and vice versa. Isn't Fun?<br><br>
                <b>About:</b>This is an example of implementation of machine learning using javascript. You can use brain.js in backend with node.js. Many problem can 
                be solved using this type of programming which can't be done using traditional programming methods<br><br>
                <b>Technical Description:</b> We have taken some RGB value to train the model of the neural network and using that dataset we 
                trained the machine what may be the dark color or light color.<br>
                To change the hex value to RGB value we created a separate function here.<br><br>
